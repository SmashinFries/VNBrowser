# VNBrowser

A simple android app for [VNDB](https://www.vndb.org).

**Currently in alpha! There will likely be bugs, crashes, and performance issues!**

**This project will move to [KuzuLabz](https://github.com/KuzuLabz) when stable.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Help needed! ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. The app logo is a placeholder (unless everyone likes it). If you can make a better one and don't mind sharing, please let me know ü§ó
2. I'm not sure how to design a good UX for searching different categories (vn, characters, staff, etc). [Goraku](https://github.com/KuzuLabz/GorakuSite) has the same issue. Any ideas or app referrences would be appreciated!

## Features
- Browse and search visual novels with many filter options

### Planned Features
